# list-pagination-and-filtering-project

Second project completed as part of the Treehouse Full Stack Javascript Techdegree. 

I was provided with the CSS and HTML code for this project by Team Treehouse. Given a list of students, I used unobtrusive vanilla JS to paginate the list of students and add a search bar / filtering feature so the list could be searched.
